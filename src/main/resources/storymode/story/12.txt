tttAfter a brief hesitation, Kaito gazed through the hole in the wall. On top of the corpse of the skewered patchwork beast stood a new creature. It was gorging itself on the carrion, tearing away large chunks of flesh with its massive mouth. Embedded in its flank were human faces, each weeping as they ripped apart any meat they could reach. Kaito could hardly find his breath as he was absorbed in the horror of the spectacle.

tttElisabeth turned and spoke with a wicked grin.

ttt“This, too, is the work of a demon. I expected as much, but it seems a second has appeared.”

ttt“I can’t believe you expected something like this…”

ttt“The beast made it here without decomposing, so its materials likely came from the neighboring village. When a demon attacks a village, he leaves few survivors. But even if as many as a fifth of the villagers escaped, the first beast seemed much too small to be made of the remaining four-fifths. It’s only natural to assume that another was forthcoming.”

tttHow can she make a prediction like that so calmly? Kaito’s head swam as he pondered that insanity.

tttAs he was thinking, the beast let out a scream.

ttt“RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!”

tttThen it leaped, its rows of breasts swaying this way and that. It dug its claws into the side of the castle. The entire castle shuddered, and dust fell from the ceiling. The beast turned its murderous eyes toward Elisabeth.

tttLooking up at the beast, whose head was protruding through the hole, Elisabeth sighed.

ttt“Heavens. Even considering you all were dragged into this, it is a pitiable sight indeed.”

ttt“GRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!”

ttt“I shall grant you reprieve. Be at peace.”

tttElisabeth snapped her fingers. The ground shattered. Countless iron stakes ripped through the earth and stretched forward. One after another, they pierced the beast’s chest. Even with its body torn to shreds, the beast still lunged forward, trying to catch Elisabeth in its maw. But its charge was impeded by over one thousand cold iron stakes.

tttIn concert with the sound of stakes piercing their target again and again, a cloud of dust mixed with crimson flower petals billowed forth like a tempest. Once it cleared, the corpses of the two beasts lay side by side. Dark blood began pooling on the ground.

tttElisabeth turned to face Kaito. A drop of blood painted her cheek, but she barely seemed to notice as she spoke.

ttt“There may yet be traces of the Knight in that village. We’re leaving. Attend to me.”

tttHer dress fluttering, Elisabeth took off. 

tttReining in his trembling legs, Kaito followed after her.
