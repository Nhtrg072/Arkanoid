tttSoon, a sweet aroma began wafting through the kitchen. To cool the pot down, Kaito carried it to the ice-spirit fridge. He let it cool for ten minutes, then brought it to the dining room.

tttTo his surprise, Elisabeth was waiting for him patiently. She must not have had anything better to do.

ttt“Hmm? Well, this is a surprise. I thought you’d make a run for it.”

ttt“Well, thanks to you, it turned out all right. See for yourself.”

tttKaito placed the earthenware pot before her. Elisabeth craned her neck inquisitively. She seemed to be waiting for him to remove the lid. Kaito grabbed the handle and did so, causing a sweet aroma to waft through the air. Upon seeing the pale-yellow substance contained within, Elisabeth cocked her head to the side.

ttt“What is this? This is not pudding.”

ttt“Huh, they really were different, then. This here is purin. It’s the version of ‘pudding’ I’m familiar with.”

ttt“Purin, you say. Hmm.”

tttParroting his word back at him, Elisabeth took a spoon and scooped out a mouthful. She frowned dubiously at it as it jiggled back and forth, then she put the spoon in her mouth. After a moment of silence, she took another spoonful.

ttt“This is quite strange…or rather… Yes…it’s so very…wobbly…and syrupy.”

tttElisabeth brought spoonful after spoonful to her mouth, eating with relentless vigor. In no time at all, the earthenware pot was empty. Her spoon clattered on the table.

ttt“I approve!”

ttt“I’ve been approved.”

tttElisabeth smiled, her expression gleaming with satisfaction, as if to tell him that he was capable of anything he set his mind to. For a moment, Kaito envisioned a pair of cat ears flopping atop her luxurious black hair.

tttFor someone who’s liable to torture others at the drop of a hat, she’s surprisingly straightforward.
