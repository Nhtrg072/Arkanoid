tttAs the hands around his neck tightened, Kaito Sena mused on how predictable this outcome was.

tttIn fact, it was a miracle that he had lived this long in the first place. His right arm was covered in shallow lacerations, his left arm unmoving and stained dark red. His ankle had been twisted at an odd angle a few months back and had stiffened that way. And it was possible that the stomach pain he had been enduring for the past three days was due to one of his organs having ruptured.

tttHe was seventeen years and three months old. All through his life, he’d only known fickle treatment and been attacked on a whim.

tttIt was a life no better than that of livestock, knowing it would eventually be devoured yet unable to escape its fate. In his case, he wasn’t going to be eaten but rather buried alive somewhere, or perhaps his flesh would be burned away until only bone remained, or maybe his body would be abandoned in the mountains or dumped in the ocean.

tttThe pain weighed heavily on him as time seemed to stretch longer and longer. While he was thinking, the fat fingers pressed down on his neck even harder, crushing his respiratory tract and blood vessels. Sticky tears leaked from his protruding eyeballs.

tttHe kicked and clawed at the hands grabbing him, but it was no use. His father was doped up well past the point of being able to reason or feel pain. As Kaito’s tongue lolled out in his desperate attempt to struggle for one more lungful of air, a part of him separated from his body and observed the situation with a disturbing level of calm. His brain, on the other hand, was burning with panic. I don’t want to die I don’t want to die I don’t want to die I don’t want to die please don’t kill me.

tttAgainst his wishes, his throat gave in. His vision went blank, but rather than infinite blackness, he saw a dancing light.

tttIt was almost like his life was flashing before his eyes, like in stories.

tttBut this was something else entirely, something sinister.

tttThere were corpses as far as the eye could see.

tttThere were men and women, young and old, their bodies mutilated and cast aside. Their hands and feet had been twisted off like those of broken dolls, their chests ripped open, their limbs torn off. Eyes, ears, teeth, and tongues were all missing.

tttBefore Kaito’s eyes lay a mountain of corpses, each lacking so much as a shred of human dignity.
